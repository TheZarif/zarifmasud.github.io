I’m **Zarif Masud**, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at **Toronto Metropolitan University**, co-supervised by Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri and Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed.  
My research focuses on **Responsible AI**, **Information Retrieval**, and **Migration Technology**, examining bias and accountability in large-scale AI systems.

Outside research, I maintain projects like the **Data Observatory**, exploring AI-assisted analysis of immigration discourse and policy.
